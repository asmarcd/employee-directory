  ## Description
  
This website simulates a employee database which you can search through by name and sort alphabetically by name, city, and country. GeneriCo is a remote operation and so has employees around the US, UK, and France. I built the site using React and JSX. The employees are randomly generated each time the page loads by the <a href= "https://randomuser.me/">Random User Generator API</a> 

  ## Installation
  
No installation necessary to use the program online. If you'd like to use the code yourself, you'll need to install the following NPM packages: 

* axios
* bootstrap
* react
* react-bootstrap
* react-dom
* react-router-dom

Then run `npm start` in your console to start the program locally
  
  ## Usage
  
Simply use the search bar and sort dropdown at the top of the page to sort through your employees.
